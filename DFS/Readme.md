Did not even get anywhere near fully functional.
Client can parse .conf, connect to server, and send a command
Client gets stuck attempting to combine the 4way split file

Servers get configured and listen for user .conf and authenticate it,
and then receive the clients command.

at least give a me a 40 or something, just for the amount of hours put into this (~30)
and yet here it is still such a stinky program because I was rushing
Happy Holidays!
