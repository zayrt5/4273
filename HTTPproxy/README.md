Make / running:

make will compile. make run will run on port 8888
make clean will clean up the exectuable


This is fairly similar to my prior server code, so not too tough.
As far as making this code, I really enjoyed it. I did not schedule enough time to implement the remaining 30% of the project (caching and blacklisting). But blacklists I would imagine are fairly simple. Caching is/was not. Could not get that in time.
The only real issue I had to look up was sending socket data bigger than the buffer.
I was on the right track, just couldm't get the data formatted right on my own.
Otherwise, I look forward to implementing the caching in the future on my own time.
